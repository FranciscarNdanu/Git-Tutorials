 #BMI Calculator

In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI.

Measurements:

1. Weight(Kgs)

2. Height(m)

BMI=Weight/(Height * Height)

We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is overweight, Normal or underweight.


We have created a branch called new_features.
