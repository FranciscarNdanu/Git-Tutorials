# BMI Calculator

In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI.

Measurements:

1. Weight(Kgs)

2. Height(m)

BMI=Weight/(Height * Height)

We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is overweight, Normal or underweight.

## Results:

If BMI>24 then the person is Overweight

If BMI is between 18 and 25, the person is normal 

If BMI <18 then the person is underweight
